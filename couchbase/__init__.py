        :param host: the hostname or IP address of the node.
          This can be a list or tuple of multiple nodes; the nodes can either
          be simple strings, or (host, port) tuples (in which case the `port`
          parameter from the method arguments is ignored).
        :type host: string or list

        :param number port: port of the management API.

          .. note::

            The value specified here is the same port used to access
            The couchbase REST UI (typically `8091`). If you have selected
            an alternate port for your bucket, do *not* put it here. The
            configuration information obtained via the REST interface will
            automatically instruct the client (once ``connect()`` is called)
            about which bucket port to connect to. Note that bucket ports
            are typically ``112xx`` - don't use these for the `port`
            parameter.

        :param string password: the password of the bucket

        :param string bucket: the bucket name

        :param boolean quiet: the flag controlling whether to raise an
          exception when the client executes operations on non-existent
          keys. If it is `False` it will raise
          :exc:`couchbase.exceptions.NotFoundError` exceptions. When set
          to `True` the operations will return `None` silently.

        :param string config_cache: If set, this will refer to a file on the
          filesystem where cached "bootstrap" information may be stored. This
          path may be shared among multiple instance of the Couchbase client.
          Using this option may reduce overhead when using many short-lived
          instances of the client.
          In older releases this was called ``conncache`` and will be aliased.

          If the file does not exist, it will be created.

        :param boolean unlock_gil: If set (which is the default), the
          connection object will release the python GIL when possible, allowing
          other (Python) threads to function in the background. This should be
          set to true if you are using threads in your application (and is the
          default), as otherwise all threads will be blocked while couchbase
          functions execute.

          You may turn this off for some performance boost and you are certain
          your application is not using threads

        :param float timeout:
          Set the timeout in seconds. If an operation takes longer than this
          many seconds, the method will return with an error. You may set this
          higher if you have slow network conditions.

        :param transcoder:
          Set the transcoder object to use. This should conform to the
          interface in the documentation (it need not actually be a subclass).
          This can be either a class type to instantiate, or an initialized
          instance.
        :type transcoder: :class:`couchbase.transcoder.Transcoder`

        :param lockmode:
          The *lockmode* for threaded access. See :ref:`multiple_threads`
          for more information.

        :param boolean experimental_gevent_support:
          This boolean value specifies whether *experimental*
          support for `gevent` should be used. Experimental support is supplied
          by substituting the built-in libcouchbase I/O functions with their
          monkey-patched `gevent` equivalents. Note that
          `gevent.monkey_patch_all` (or similar) must have already been called
          in order to ensure that the cooperative socket methods are called.

          .. warning::

            As the parameter name implies, this feature is experimental. This
            means it may crash or hang your application. While no known issues
            have been discovered at the time of writing, it has not been
            sufficiently tested and as such is marked as experimental.

            API and implementation of this feature are subject to change.
